## 📘 Basic Overview

<br>

The assignment involves an FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading) vessel data. The vessel contains some equipment and each equipment have multiple sensors. Every time a failure happens, we get all the sensors data from the failed equipment and we store this information in a log file, the time is in GMT time zone.


You are provided 3 files: the log file named equipment_failure_sensors.log; the file named equipment_sensors.csv with the relationships between sensors and equipment and the file named equipment.json with the equipment data.


To solve this problem, we expect you to answer a few questions related to January 2020 considering GMT time
zone:
